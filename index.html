    <h1>My Journey to Learn Every Art Form</h1>

    <img class = "img_left" ALIGN = "left" src="images/baby_picture.jpg" alt="six year old me">

    <p>I’ve been an artist for as long as I can remember.</p>

    <p>I still remember being at summer camp when I was six, where, as an anxious and homesick kid, I would make bracelets or draw pictures for my mom. All. Day. Long. As I got older and gained internet access, the scope of what I could explore and try out expanded by multitudes, and thus so did my art. Soon enough, my basement, which was (and still is) full of trims, notions, and beads for my dad’s business, became accessible. I remember my dad teaching me how to use needle nose pliers to make jewelry and (as a lover of shiny things!) I was hooked. After that, I expanded beyond what was simply in front of me; I got new supplies and tried more trades. Now that I'm in a place where I have freedom regarding what I can pursue, I can plan and undertake bigger and better projects and test the limits of what I can make.</p>

    <p>I find myself drawn to physical art forms, art that is more concrete than pictures on paper or digital art. While I love looking at and being inspired by traditional art forms, the appeal of physical art is in its usability. Each piece I make has a purpose and fulfills a role in my everyday life, whether accessory or utilitarian. I get a lot of joy from seeing the things I make being put to use and well-loved rather than collecting dust in the back of a closet or on display. </p>
    
    <p> Whenever I resolve to learn a new skill, it’s usually because it’s been taking over my Pinterest and/or Instagram feeds, which is where I find most of my inspiration. I start the process of learning with a lot of research. I watch videos, read tutorials, and find potential projects that would be feasible for a beginner. I have a master Pinterest board for everything related to crafts, so I make a new section for whatever art form I’m looking into. Following research, I buy supplies when I have at least a decent idea of what I’m doing and what I want my first project to be. I first go for the cheapest option I can find and invest in better tools and materials as I improve. From there, the pattern stays the same, and I get into the flow of working on project after project. I’ve learned a lot through this process; planning projects, learning new skills, and trying things I've never done before have made me a better critical thinker and a better problem solver.</p>
